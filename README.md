## About the Quantum Network Approach

The "quantum network" theory is an innovative method for simulating district heating/cooling networks that:
- Eliminates time-consuming iterative procedures
- Uses energy distribution based on discontinuous quantities (quanta)
- Provides flexibility for both simplified studies and detailed planning
- Is implemented in the ADVENS simulation tool
